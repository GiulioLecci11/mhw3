# Mini HomeWork 3 - Giulio Lecci
Made for Web Programming course at @Unict. <br>
For this task I added 2 Application Program Interfaces to my old mhw1. <br> 
The first one was about the Marvel Universe, while the second connects directly to Spotify, allowing you to look for some soundtracks. It also uses the OAuth2 protocol while the Marvel one uses public and private keys.
